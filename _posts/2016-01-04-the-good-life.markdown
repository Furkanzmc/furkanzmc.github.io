With the age of seemingly overnight successes, glamorous life of celebrities and people with money it just seems like a no brainer that people would choose money and fame as a way of ultimate happiness in life. But, are they really the right choice? I recently watched a TEDx talk by `Robert Waldinger` that addresses this question. Since the 1930's, Harvard psychologists have been carrying out perhaps the longest study of human life with 724 participants. This is really one of a kind study because most of the studies that start out to be a long one gets cut out because they lose funding, or people die. But this one has lived up to be 75 years old and 60 of those 724 men are still participating in the study.

They started with 724 kids, from different backgrounds, and started tracking them throughout their lives for 75 years and counting. And these men grew up to be factory workers, lawyers, and one of them became the president of the United States. They divided the subjects into two groups: First group finished college and the second group was selected from one of the poorest places. Scientists interviewed them, their parents and all of the participants had medical examinations. And these carried on every year. They also scan the participants brain, video taped them talking to their wives and a decade ago they included the wives into the study.

After collecting this huge amount of data from all of those people, `Robert Waldinger` shares the 3 big lessons that they concluded. And these lessons aren't about wealth, fame, or working harder and harder. The clear and top-level message that has 3 main effects is good relationships keep us happier and healthier.

# #1: Social connections are really good for us, and loneliness kills

Scientists concluded that more connected people are happier, physically stronger and they live longer. And people who are more isolated are less happy, their health declines sooner and they live shorter lives. Which is bad news because, as `Robert Waldinger` says, 1 in 5 Americans report loneliness in their lives. So you might feel lucky If you are an introvert who likes to party a lot and knows people, and if you are an introvert you might feel doomed but don't assume anything till you read the lesson #2.

# #2: It's not the quantity of your relationships but the quality

Turns out no matter how big your social circle is If you don't feel like you can really trust the people in your life it doesn't really matter how many Facebook friends you have. So it really doesn't matter how many friends you have as long as you have really strong connections with the ones you have. Even those who reported high satisfaction from their marriages still had fights and conflicts. But at the end of the day, they knew they could count on each other. But without that strong connection and trust, high conflict marriages are really bad for us, maybe worse than divorce. Moreover, the satisfaction of your relationships affects your life at an old age. The people who were most satisfied with their life were better at an old age than the others. And people who had satisfying relationships reported same level of happiness even on the days of physical pain whereas people with unsatisfying relationships reported more pain and unhappiness.

# #3: Good relationships don't just protect our bodies, they also protect our brain

People on the higher scale of happiness stayed sharper, longer. But the ones on the lower part lived shorter lives and their brains declined earlier. `Robert Waldinger` says that from $75.00 to $75.000.000, our happiness changes very little. So we are valuing the wrong things for the right reasons. We all want to be happy but we cling on the superficial things that we think might make us happier. While we work hard to get that promotion, we take our relationships for granted and stop working on them. But like everything else, relationships require work too. They are hard, life long and requires work. So to be actually happy requires you to take that weekend off from your work and work on your family/friends/loved ones.

It is so simple, but seems so hard to do.
