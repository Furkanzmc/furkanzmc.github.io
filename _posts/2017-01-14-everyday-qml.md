# Overview

I've been using QML for a while now. And although it is used, there are not many tutorials and examples that speak to a person who just started.
So I decided to to start something similar to the [100 Days of Swift](http://samvlu.com/).
I will try to create a sample project along with a blog post that explains the code. I will also make sure to include some comments in the code.
I hope this will be use to someone out there.

# Day 1

The day one project is from the [100 Days of Swift](http://samvlu.com/) web site and it is a simple app that increases a number when clicked on a button.

With this simple project you learn how to:

- Build a custom component with QML
- Use `MouseArea`
- Use the `property` system in a very simple way
- Use `anchors` to position the QML elements

You can find the source code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Furkanzmc/Everyday-QML) account.
